## Knowledges

+ If you are wondering that how to setup a darwinia node, check [this][node].

+ If you want to reset genesis header, your sudo account must has the related authority, the sudo account has the root authority by default, in local dev network.

+ the redeem receiver account must not be dead account (have been deposited before)

+ the receipt proof spec of the smart contract, including the knowledge or prefixed receiver hex address, and validation. (Normal subkey hex address(public key) does not include prefix)

+ More turorials, please check [this][guide].


Don't worry if you don't know how to check the tips above, the tools below will help you testing darwinia with just putting them inside a black-box.


## Test Tools

### Integration Tests

> Please make sure your local darwinia node is running and ports `ws` to `9944`, this is all you need.

```
ùù∫ yarn proof
yarn run v1.21.1
$ ts-node ./scripts/relay.ts
? Test which process? ‚Ä∫ - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
‚ùØ   All - Test all process dynamic
    Get Balances
    Genesis header
    Relay header
    Redeem
```

### Relay services

```
yarn relay:services
```

This tool will raise 3 relay services to test the eth-relay in darwinia.


## Services

### Crash Uncle

```
yarn crash
```

This tool is provided in `scripts/crash.ts`, we can keep sending redeem requests till we don't have any eth, used for fetching the eth block both has our txes and uncles.


### Relay Service

```
yarn relay
```

Keep relaying eth blocks to darwinia


### Fetcher Service

```
yarn fetch
```

Keep fetching eth blocks, convert them into darwinia-eth-blocks and save in `~/.darwinia/relay_blocks.db` by default.


## Note

### Accounts

If you burn out all eth in this account, please deposit some back into it, then we are still good friends.

You can just 

```
wget https://faucet.ropsten.be/donate/0x2c7536E3605D9C16a7a3D7b1898e529396a65c23
```

in command line or click [https://faucet.ropsten.be/][0] and paste `0x2c7536E3605D9C16a7a3D7b1898e529396a65c23` to the input box, don't forget to click `Send me test Ether` before you closing the generous window.
